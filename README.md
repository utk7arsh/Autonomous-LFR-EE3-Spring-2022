# PID-Line-Following-Robot
Submission for Electrical Engineering 3 - Introduction to Electrical Engineering taught by Professor Dennis Briggs. 
We had to program a autonomous line following robot using PID. Our car completed the track in 17 seconds qualifying for extra credit for clearing the track under 20 seconds. 

## Learning Outcomes of the class
-  Understanding of the basics of electrical circuit theory
-  Awareness of the sub-fields of EE 
-  Awareness of the history of EE 
-  Accumulation of laboratory skills, experience with laboratory instruments
-  Experience with real-time embedded systems programming
