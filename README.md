# Autonomous PID based Line Following Robot
Submission for Electrical Engineering 3 - Introduction to Electrical Engineering at UCLA taught by Professor Dennis Briggs taken in Spring 2022. 
We had to program a autonomous line following robot using PID. The car used for the project was a Texas Instrument TI MSP432P401R Launchpad. It used L239D H Bridge for motor control, arduino nano as primary microcontroller to read and interpret IR Values, and LED with Halls Effect Sensor to detect turns. 

Our project was able to complete the track in 17 seconds on the race day which qualified us for extra credit for getting the time under 20 seconds threshold. 

## Learning Outcomes of the class
-  Understanding of the basics of electrical circuit theory
-  Awareness of the sub-fields of EE 
-  Awareness of the history of EE 
-  Accumulation of laboratory skills, experience with laboratory instruments
-  Experience with real-time embedded systems programming

## Track for the race
The entire path included two sharps turns, one curve and an end point where the car had to make a 180 degree spin to retrace the track and return to its starting point.
